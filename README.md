## 📝 How to Contribute?

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository 📌
2. Clone your forked repository 🎯
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/debarghamitraroy/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms.git
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your changes 🌱
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
   ```
4. Navigate to the respective platform folder and create a new folder for the problem you are solving. The folder name should be the same as the problem name.
   ```bash
   cd <PLATFORM_NAME>
   touch <PROBLEM_NAME>.c <PROBLEM_NAME>.cpp <PROBLEM_NAME>.java <PROBLEM_NAME>.py
   ```
   - **Example:** If you are solving a problem named "[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)" on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), create a file named `1. Two Sum.cpp` inside the `LeetCode` folder.
   - The folder structure should look like this:
     ```
     📂 LeetCode
      ├── 1. Two Sum.c
      ├── 1. Two Sum.cpp
      ├── 1. Two Sum.java
      ├── 1. Two Sum.py
      └── README.md
     ```
   - Create code files in the respective languages you are comfortable with. You can also create a `README.md` file inside the problem folder to explain your approach or any other details related to the problem.
   - **Note:** Please follow the naming convention for the folder and file names to maintain consistency across the repository.
5. Add your solutions inside the respective folder 🔥
6. Commit and push your changes 🚀
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "<YOUR_COMMMIT_MESSAGE>"
   git push origin <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
   ```
